{{< side-hero src="/images/logo.png" alt="Adrián 'Quihacker' Ramos — Quihacker" width="140" >}}
I’m **Adrián “Quihacker” Ramos** — La Mancha–born, sporting the regulation mustache. I cut my teeth on the web arts — CMSs, GUIs, and back ends; honed the craft in automotive and at a full-stack startup, from forge to banner. Then I traded my nag for a cluster: **Big Data** with **Spark/Kafka**, first in consulting and later in banking, tuning risk engines until the numbers ran. After that I crossed into product: connectors, storage, and data marketplaces; I wrangled graphs and metadata. Along the road I learned to put **AI** at the service of the trade: **LLMs** as a **knowledge still** and **project accelerator**; **ML** when it’s time to measure or automate with data.

Today I ride between **offensive security** and **software architecture in Rust**: from the iron (hardware hacking) up to **event-driven systems that are highly concurrent and efficient**, with **DDD** and **Event Sourcing** as my compass, and **pragmatic AI** when it helps (to refine and gain speed, not to replace judgment). I’m obsessed with **detail**: I forge software for battle and launch the first charge myself — **lance at the ready** — before anyone outside the lab does… and I keep looking for new windmills.

### Purpose of my wanderings

To **tell my bouts and field notes** and, along the way, **distill what’s already written**. This log is both workshop and field notebook: **reproducible POCs**, **real code**, and design notes that anyone can retrace step by step. Plus **no-hype AI**: when to use it to refine and accelerate, and where it has no business. Here I document the how and the why without shortcuts: **what I learned, what failed, and what worked**.
